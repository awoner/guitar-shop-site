    <section><h2>Gitar Keren's review on Taylor Guitars Builder's Edition K14CE</h2>
        <img src="app/resources/images/review.jpg">
        <p>Toward the end of last year, there were some rumors that Taylor Guitars was in the midst
            of unveiling something truly groundbreaking in acoustic guitar design. The innovation, created by
            Taylor’s master guitar designer, Andy Powers, deceptively appeared as the stunningly beautiful Builder’s
            Edition K14ce acoustic, a top-of-the-line model that’s being reviewed here. But don’t get me wrong, this
            particular acoustic is not necessarily the innovation (even though it possesses plenty of
            visionary enhancements). That distinction belongs to Taylor’s brand-new patented V-Class bracing, which
            is found underneath the top of this meticulously crafted instrument.</p>

            <p>While some of you might find this revelation somewhat banal, keep in mind that advancements in
                acoustic guitar bracing patterns have been almost nonexistent in the last 100 years. And whether
                you realize it or not, the bracing in an acoustic is incontrovertibly its sonic wellspring, which not
                only determines the instrument’s inherent volume projection, but also its effectiveness for
                sustain. So, considering all of that, Powers’ inventive V-Class bracing precisely creates an
                entirely new architecture and orchestration—or, if you will, refinement—under the top that produces
                an acoustic with far more volume and increased sustain, not to mention unlimited dynamic range.
                And, as a by-product of this new bracing pattern, simple and complex chords ring true with flawless
                intonation no matter where or how you voice them across the fretboard.</p>



            <p>It’s not often an influential innovation comes along that is eye-opening, but here, I can genuinely
                say V-Class bracing, endowed in the Builder’s Edition K14ce acoustic, is indeed an astonishing and
                unprecedented game changer in acoustic design, performance and sound.</p>

            <p>FEATURES Currently, V-Class bracing is featured on four new Taylor Grand Auditorium models (including
                this K14ce), all of which are premium editions; but fear not, Taylor plans on implementing their
                radical new V-Class architecture across their acoustic line in the near future. The Builder’s Edition
                K14ce, which was handmade by Powers, is a devoted work of art in bespoke craftsmanship and ergonomic
                design.</p>

            <p>Beginning with a Grand Auditorium body style, the K14ce features Hawaiian koa back and sides combined
                with a Sitka spruce top that is torrefied (a roasting process to remove moisture that also darkens the
                top and ages the wood for tonal sweetness). Because this acoustic is a “Builder’s Edition,” it dials
                in exclusive appointments like a beveled armrest that alleviates stress points by putting your forearm
                in a more relaxed position for a comfortable playing experience. Adding to its thoughtful geometry,
                there’s also a sleekly contoured cutaway that weaves in a finger bevel, which allows the mahogany
                neck to flow seamlessly into the heel and soundboard, providing graceful access to upper-register
                notes on the fingerboard.</p>



            <p>The K14ce displays an attractive Kona burst with a “silent” satin finish that curbs random noises
                when pressed against the body, a gorgeous koa/paua top and back trim and an intricately beautiful
                “Spring Vine” inlay on its West African ebony fingerboard. Other important features include a new
                black graphite nut, premium Gotoh 510 tuners and Taylor’s Expression System 2 electronics. To further
                ensure that this is a new beginning in the genesis of Taylor acoustics, a new guitar label was created
                with Powers’ signature inside the soundhole.</p>

            <p>PERFORMANCE Words fail to capture the liveliness and nuanced feel of the Builder’s Edition K14ce
                because it is truly unlike any other acoustic I’ve come across, where individual notes sustain almost
                indefinitely and chords sound perfectly in tune irrespective of where I voice them. It’s really
                something to hear the exceptional balance playing the K14ce both loudly and softly, insomuch as the
                acoustic consistently translates the relationship between each string in harmonious detail and
                immaculate intonation without choking any string’s specific frequency.</p>


            <p>Besides the overall beauty of the guitar and player-friendly ergonomics, it projects a sweetened response
        and is deeply resonant, making every musical passage sound more robust. Taylor’s ES 2 electronics sound
        outstanding when playing live, but the acoustic absolutely sounds exquisite when it’s close miked. I believe
        Taylor’s Builder’s Edition K14ce—with its V-Class architecture—is an original and will be considered
        a milestone in the evolution of instruments that push the boundaries of musical expression.</p>
