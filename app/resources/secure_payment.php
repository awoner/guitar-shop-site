        <h3><b>1. Payment Security</b></h3><br>
        <p>Your money is not released during the trade process until you have confirmed successful delivery of
            the order. Once confirmed, Alibaba will release payment to the supplier. All of your information will
            be safely encrypted.</p>
        <h3><b>2. Full Refund</b></h3><br>
        <p>If the supplier doesn't ship your order on time, or if you don't receive it and it is determined to be
                the fault of the supplier, you'll get your payment returned directly.</p>
        <h3><b>3. Partial Refund & Keeping Products</b></h3><br>
        <p> If the products you receive are significantly different from the product requirements agreed on within
            the contract, you may choose to receive a partial refund and keep the products.</p>
